* \#X, .Y
* X Y, X > Y
* X + Y and X ~ Y

## Sibling Combinators

### X + Y

Selects Adjacent Element

```css
.first-born + .second-born {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<div class="parent">
	<div class="first-born">1st</div>
	<div class="second-born">2nd</div>
</div>
```



## Sibling Combinators

### X ~ Y

Selects All Siblings

```css
.first-born ~ div {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<div class="parent">
	<div class="first-born">1st</div>
	<div>2nd</div>
	<div>3rd</div>
</div>
```



## Attribute Selectors

* [attr]

	Represents an element with an attribute name of attr.
  
* [attr=value]

	Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value is
    exactly "value".



## Attribute Selectors

* [attr~=value]

	Represents an element with an attribute name of attr whose value is a
    whitespace-separated list of words, one of which is exactly "value".

* [attr|=value]

	Represents an element with an attribute name of attr. Its value can be
    exactly “value” or can begin with “value” immediately followed by “-”
    (U+002D). It can be used for language subcode matches.



## Attribute Selectors

* [attr^=value]

	Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value is
    prefixed by "value".

* [attr$=value]

	Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value is
    suffixed by "value".
	
* [attr*=value]

	Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value
    contains at least one occurrence of string "value" as substring.



## CSS Specificity

* [Specifics on CSS Specificity](http://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/)
* [MDN CSS Specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity)



## Positioning

1. Absolute Positioning
2. Fixed Positioning
3. Relative Positioning
4. Stacking Contexts
5. Floating and Clearing



## Absolute Positioning

* [Containing Block](http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/containingblock)
* `position: absolute`
* `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`



## Fixed Positioning

* `position: fixed`

	Same as absolute positioning, but the containing block is always the
    viewport.



## Relative Positioning

* `position: relative`

	Content flow normally, like the default value, `position: static`, but
    shifted vertically and/or horizontally depending on `top`, `bottom`, `left`,
    `right`.



## Stacking Contexts

* Web pages are 2D, but boxes are 3D.
* Absolutely for fixed positioned elements may overlap.
* Starts at 0, negative numbers move block back, positive to front.

```
z-index: 999;
```



## Floats

[Reference](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/world/africa/who-weighing-emergency-decree-on-ebola.html?ref=world)



## Characteristics of Floats

* Non-floated content "float" around floated boxes, but other boxes in flow
[completely ignore them](http://jsbin.com/azuwul/1/edit)
* A floated box is taken out of the flow, doesn’t affect the block-level boxes
  around it.
* Floated box is shifted to the left or right until its *margin edge* touches the
  *padding edge* of the **containing block**
* No [Margin Collapsing](http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/collapsing-margins/)

```
float: left|right|none;
```



## Clearing

Used to force an element to start below any floated elements.

```
clear: left|right|both;
```
Why? Because the floated element is taken out of the normal flow, so its
dimension isn't taken account by it's containing block, i.e. parent shorted than
child.



## Clearfix

In short:

```
.clearfix {
	overflow: auto;
}
```

But...
